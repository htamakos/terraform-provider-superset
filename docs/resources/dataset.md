## Example Usage

```terraform

## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The database name of the Dataset.
- `table_name` (String) The name of the Dataset.

### Optional

- `always_filter_main_dttm` (Boolean) The always filter main dttm of the Dataset.
- `cache_timeout` (Number) The cache timeout of the Dataset.
- `catalog` (String) The catalog of the Dataset.
- `description` (String) The description of the Dataset.

- `id` (Number) The ID of the Dataset.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
